# Sierra Leone EBOV analysis - Model specification
_Bernardo Gutierrez_

Model parameters specified in BEAST 2 XMLs

1. We use a strict clock; we set a prior as a normal distribution with median rate of 0.0012 s/s/y and bound the values across all estimates from the Holmes _et al_ analysis: the lower bound corresponds to Hoenen _et al_ lower bound (0.00089 s/s/y) and the upper bound is from Gire _et al_ (0.00291 s/s/y).
2. We use an **HKY + Γ** substitution model (4 discrete categories to model the Γ distribution for rate heterogeneity).
3. Pending: origin date
4. Pending: latency period
4. Pending: detection probability
