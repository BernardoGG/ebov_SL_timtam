# Sierra Leone EBOV analysis - NOTES
_Bernardo Gutierrez_

- Holmes _et al_ (2016) presents a retrospective analysis of the 2014-2016 Western Africa EBOV epidemic. Evolutionary rate analysis here is used as a basis for parametrising our model.
- Case reporting rates for the Western Africa epidemic vary broadly and are represented by four main studies.
	* Meltzer _et al_ (2014) uses an expert opinion on bed occupancy attributable to Ebola virus disease in Liberia to estimate a 2.5-fold underreporting rate.
	* Scarpino _et al_ (2014) used phylodynamic analysis of sequences from Sierra Leone and the Meltzer _et al_ estimate a 17% of underreporting, substantially lower than the aforementioned study. They acknowledge wide confidence intervals and also report raw underreporting percentages of 58% (95% CI: 20 % - 99%).
	* Gignoux _et al_ (2015) used a capture-recapture approach with data from Liberia (Montserrado county) to estimate an 3-fold increase from true case from reported cases.
	* A retrospective analysis with a hierarchical binomial model by Dalziel _et al_ (2018) analyses four different regions in Sierra Leone and finds that, for the time period covered in our analysis, the reporting rate in Bo district (neighbouring Kenema) is close to the estimates by Meltzer _et al_ and Gignoux _et al_.
- Gire _et al_ (2014) presents a phylodynamic analysis of the early EBOV spread in Western Africa, including the likely introduction of the virus from its estimated epidemic origin in Guinea to Sierra Leone. Two lineages (SL1 and SL2) were detected early on, they are both sister lineages and diverged some time in late April 2014 (23 April, 95% HPD: 2 April to 13 May), and cases in Sierra Leone (Kenema) were detected from late May onwards.
